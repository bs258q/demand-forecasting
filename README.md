Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - More Comprehensive:

Time Series Decomposition (Again, but Emphasized): The Kaggle notebook heavily emphasizes time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual). It uses seasonal_decompose but visually interprets the results more thoroughly. We did this too, but it's worth highlighting.

Seasonality Check (ACF/PACF Plots): The notebook uses Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to identify the order of AR and MA components for ARIMA models. This is a standard technique for time series analysis and model selection that we didn't explicitly include.

Forecasting Models - More Variety and Sophistication:

Exponential Smoothing Models (ESM): The core of the notebook is using Exponential Smoothing Models. Specifically, it uses SimpleExpSmoothing, Holt, and HoltWinters models from the statsmodels library. This is a major area where we could expand. ESM models are well-suited for time series data with trend and seasonality.

ARIMA Models: While the notebook briefly mentions ARIMA, it's a critical class of time series models worth considering.

Model Selection Criteria (AIC, BIC): The notebook mentions using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare and select the best model. These are statistical measures that help balance model fit and complexity.

Residual Analysis:

Checking for Normality and Autocorrelation in Residuals: The notebook analyzes the residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) to ensure they are normally distributed and have no autocorrelation. This is a key step in validating a time series model. If residuals aren't random, it suggests the model is missing something.

Forecasting Evaluation:

Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE): The notebook uses RMSLE, which penalizes underestimation more than overestimation. This can be useful in certain business contexts. We used MAE and RMSE, which are more common, but RMSLE is another option.

Visualizations:

Clearer Forecast Plots: The notebook has clear visualizations that show the historical data, the training period, the testing period, and the forecast. Our plotting was more basic.
