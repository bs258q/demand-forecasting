Demand Forecasting for ML Engineers: A Checklist for Success

As a machine learning engineer diving into time series or demand forecasting, consider these key areas to ensure robust and reliable models:

1. Data Wrangling & Exploration is King:

Date Handling: Ensure correct parsing and handling of date/time data, setting it as the index for time-based operations. Robust error handling for data loading and parsing is essential.

Visual EDA: Go beyond summary statistics. Thoroughly examine your data for trends, seasonality, and outliers through visualization techniques like time series plots and boxplots.

Time Series Decomposition: Decompose your series to isolate trend, seasonality, and residual components. While seasonal_decompose is a start, explore more advanced techniques like STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) for robustness against outliers and evolving seasonality.

2. Feature Engineering for Temporal Awareness:

Lag Features: Incorporate lagged values of the target variable as predictors. Crucially, avoid data leakage by using shift(1) and filling initial NaN values appropriately.

Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling means, sums, or other statistics to capture short-term trends. Remember to shift these features to prevent leakage.

Cyclical Features: Represent cyclical patterns (e.g., months, days) using sine and cosine transformations for better model understanding of relationships.

3. Model Selection & Evaluation: Beyond the Defaults:

Autocorrelation Analysis: Use ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots to understand the autocorrelation structure and inform the selection of ARIMA model orders (p, q).

Exponential Smoothing Models (ESM): Explore SimpleExpSmoothing, Holt, and Holt-Winters models as strong baselines, especially for data with trend and seasonality.

ARIMA Models: Consider ARIMA (or its seasonal variant, SARIMA) if autocorrelation analysis suggests it.

Stationarity Testing: Before applying models that assume stationarity, test for it using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and apply differencing if necessary.

Cross-Validation: Respect the Time Dimension: Utilize TimeSeriesSplit to ensure training and testing sets maintain chronological order, preventing data leakage and providing a realistic performance estimate.

Evaluation Metrics: Context Matters: Don't rely solely on MAE and RMSE. Consider RMSLE (penalizes underestimation) or sMAPE to align with your specific business costs and objectives.

4. Validate, Analyze, and Refine:

Residual Analysis: Validate your model by analyzing the residuals. Check for normality and autocorrelation. Non-random residuals suggest the model is missing key patterns.

5. Deployment & Maintenance:

Careful Data Scaling: Apply scalers (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) within your cross-validation loop to prevent data leakage. Fit on training data and transform on test data for each split.

Serialization: Save your trained model after cross-validation. For production, retrain the best-performing model on all available data before serialization. Save the fitted scaler as well!

Prediction Pipeline: Ensure your prediction pipeline accurately replicates the feature engineering and scaling steps used during training.

Monitoring & Retraining: Implement monitoring for forecast accuracy and data drift. Establish a retraining strategy triggered by performance degradation or significant data changes.

By diligently addressing these points, you can build more accurate, reliable, and ultimately, more valuable demand forecasting models.



🚀 Mastering Demand Forecasting as an ML Engineer: A Checklist for Success

As machine learning engineers, diving into time series forecasting can be both exciting and challenging! 📈 From handling messy date formats to ensuring your models don’t fall victim to data leakage, every step matters.

Here’s a battle-tested checklist to help you build accurate and reliable demand forecasting models:

🔍 1. Data Wrangling & Exploration:
✅ Parse dates correctly, set them as the index, and handle missing timestamps.
✅ Go beyond summary statistics—visualize trends, seasonality, and outliers.
✅ Use time series decomposition (STL, seasonal_decompose) to break data into trend, seasonality, and noise.

🛠 2. Feature Engineering for Temporal Awareness:
✅ Use lag features (shifted values of the target) carefully to avoid data leakage.
✅ Compute rolling statistics (mean, sum, etc.) to capture short-term trends.
✅ Represent cyclical time patterns (e.g., months, days) using sine & cosine transformations.

📊 3. Model Selection & Evaluation:
✅ Understand autocorrelation with ACF & PACF plots before choosing ARIMA or SARIMA.
✅ Test for stationarity (ADF test) and apply differencing if needed.
✅ Use Exponential Smoothing Models (Holt, Holt-Winters) as strong baselines.
✅ Apply TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation—no random splits in time series!
✅ Choose the right metrics: MAE, RMSE, or sMAPE based on business needs.

🔎 4. Validate, Analyze & Refine:
✅ Analyze residuals—randomness means your model is on the right track!
✅ Non-random residuals? Your model is missing key patterns—go back & refine.

🚀 5. Deployment & Maintenance:
✅ Scale data properly (fit scalers only on training data to prevent leakage).
✅ Save models & scalers for seamless production deployment.
✅ Set up forecast monitoring—detect data drift & retrain when needed.

📢 Forecasting isn't just about throwing models at data. It’s about understanding the patterns, designing the right features, and continuously improving!
